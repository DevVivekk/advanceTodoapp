A Complex Frontend Project Experience:-
ðŸ‘‰ I was building a nested comment and reply system like reddit. First I want to mention tech stacks I used were node.js, express.js and mongodb. The backend was smooth and no issues were there. And I in the frontend I was using next.js and the problem was that how can i perform nesting. It went successfull for the comments with it replies and then in the replies of the relplies i faced some issues. I solved that my creating two components with same functionality and on mapping the comments array,I mapped those two components with each other. This worked!
